This repository is a fork of the class project repository created for the
Application Development program, class 320, at North Seattle College.

This continuation will strive to restructure the code, utilizing better modular
programming. I will also be trying out some new javascript and using Bootstrap
code from [bootsnipp.com](www.bootsnipp.com "BootSnipp").

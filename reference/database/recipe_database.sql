You want it to be very thick, thicker than cake mix, more like a brownie mix is. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. (If I\'m in a hurry, I place the saucepan over ice in the sink for about 10 minutes or so until the mixture cools.) It must be completely cool before you use it in the next step. Stir in vanilla. <br><br>While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. You don\'t want any sugar graininess left. Then add the completely cooled milk/flour/vanilla mixture and beat the living daylights out of it. If it looks separated, you haven\'t beaten it enough! Beat it until it all combines and resembles whipped cream.<br><br>Grab a spoon and taste this wonderful goodness. If there is any left after your taste test, spread it on a cooled chocolate cake. <br><br>Cut yourself a piece and put it on a pretty plate. Grab a fork and prepare to experience the most divine pairing you can imagine. This frosting on chocolate cake is to die for. Sure, the recipe sounds strange -- it has flour in it -- but it\'s sublime. Try it, you\'ll see. You\'ll love it so much you won\'t go back. <br><br>Oct 2015 update: TIPS! Use only real butter!! (My personal preference is the organic salted butter from Costco as to me it has a more rich and buttery taste.) Do not use margarine, tub spreads, Country Crock, etc as the frosting is likely to separate. Some people like to use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, or to run the granulated sugar through a food processor first to make their own superfine sugar. If you taste flour or paste when it\'s done, I suspect the flour/milk mixture didn\'t cook long enough, don\'t be in a hurry to bring the milk/flour to the thickened state, let it have time to cook that flour taste out as it thickens. Did you get lumps? whisk whisk whisk as it cooks! One person recommended using a hand mixer as it cooks to avoid lumps, Some people use 3 T of flour instead of 5. I\'ve made it with soy milk, non-fat milk and all the way through to half-n-half and it\'s turned out great for me using any of those. I\'ve put it in piping bags and decorated with it, I\'ve left it on the counter and I\'ve also refrigerated it. I\'m not a professional baker and while I\'ve never had this recipe fail, I highly recommend reading the comments, there are great tips and helpful comments! Some have recommendations for adding cocoa powder, cherry, fresh strawberries, using coconut oil, etc. One person used lavender and earl grey tea in it (I recommended she post that recipe!) Some people have put the sugar in with the milk/flour mixture instead of creaming it with the butter. (I\'ve tried that and personally wasn\'t a fan as it completely changed the flavor, and texture, of the frosting in the end.) Also, while I like this best on chocolate cake, you can use it on any flavor of cake. In fact, it\'s the original, very old, frosting for Red Velvet Cake. Yep, that\'s right! Cream cheese frosting is not the original frosting for Red Velvet :) Happy baking! Have fun, and enjoy!! ~MissyDew', 393),

Place some chicken in the middle of a tortilla, then fold tortilla in half. Clamp the tortilla shut with a pair of heat-proof metal tongs, then carefully lay the taco---one side down---in the oil. As you lay it in the oil, use the tongs to hold the top side down for a few seconds to form it in place. Once it stays put, repeat with two other tacos. Turn tacos after 30 to 45 seconds, or when each side gets light golden brown (not too brown.)<br><br>One at a time, remove tacos from the pan with tongs, holding sideways as you remove them to allow oil to drip out of the sides.

Sure, the recipe sounds strange -- it has flour in it -- but it\'s sublime. Try it, you\'ll see. You\'ll love it so much you won\'t go back. <br><br>Oct 2015 update: TIPS! Use only real butter!! (My personal preference is the organic salted butter from Costco as to me it has a more rich and buttery taste.) Do not use margarine, tub spreads, Country Crock, etc as the frosting is likely to separate. Some people like to use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, or to run the granulated sugar through a food processor first to make their own superfine sugar. If you taste flour or paste when it\'s done, I suspect the flour/milk mixture didn\'t cook long enough, don\'t be in a hurry to bring the milk/flour to the thickened state, let it have time to cook that flour taste out as it thickens. Did you get lumps? whisk whisk whisk as it cooks! One person recommended using a hand mixer as it cooks to avoid lumps, Some people use 3 T of flour instead of 5. I\'ve made it with soy milk, non-fat milk and all the way through to half-n-half and it\'s turned out great for me using any of those. I\'ve put it in piping bags and decorated with it, I\'ve left it on the counter and I\'ve also refrigerated it. I\'m not a professional baker and while I\'ve never had this recipe fail, I highly recommend reading the comments, there are great tips and helpful comments! Some have recommendations for adding cocoa powder, cherry, fresh strawberries, using coconut oil, etc. One person used lavender and earl grey tea in it (I recommended she post that recipe!) Some people have put the sugar in with the milk/flour mixture instead of creaming it with the butter. (I\'ve tried that and personally wasn\'t a fan as it completely changed the flavor, and texture, of the frosting in the end.) Also, while I like this best on chocolate cake, you can use it on any flavor of cake. In fact, it\'s the original, very old, frosting for Red Velvet Cake. Yep, that\'s right! Cream cheese frosting is not the original frosting for Red Velvet :) Happy baking! Have fun, and enjoy!! ~MissyDew', 405),

Add beaten eggs to melted butter, stirring constantly to make sure the butter\'s not too hot for the eggs.<br>7. Add the egg/butter mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook. <br>8. With the mixer on 3 or medium-low speed, pour in the yeast mixture. <br>9. Allow the dough hook to stir this mixture for a couple of minutes, making sure it\'s thoroughly combined.<br>10. With the mixer still going, add helpings of the flour mixture in 1/4 to 1/2 cup increments until all the flour is gone. <br>11. Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl, then turn the mixer on the same speed for five whole minutes. <br>12. After five minutes, stop the mixer and scrape the bottom of the bowl. <br>13. Turn on the mixer for 30 seconds.<br>14. Turn off the mixer and allow the dough to sit in the bowl undisturbed for 10 minutes.<br>15. After 10 minutes, transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Toss the dough to coat, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place straight in the fridge.<br>16. Refrigerate dough for at least 8 hours, or overnight.<br><br>To Make the Doughnuts:<br><br>1. Remove bowl from fridge and turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.<br>2. Roll out to 1/4 to 1/3-inch thickness.<br>3. Using a 3-inch cutter, cut as many rounds as you can, then roll out remaining dough and cut as much as you can, etc.<br>4. Cut holes out of each round using a 1 1/2-inch cutter.<br>5. Place both doughnuts and holes on a floured baking sheet.<br>6. Cover with large tea towel and place in a warm place in your kitchen; my kitchen is very drafty, so I have to briefly warm the griddle, then turn it off and set the sheets on top to keep warm.<br>7. Allow doughnuts to rise undisturbed for at least 1 hour; 1 hour 15 minutes if necessary. Doughuts should be visibly puffier and appear to be airy.<br><br><br>To Fry the Dougnuts<br><br>1. Heat plenty of vegetable shortening in a large pot until the temperature reaches 375 to 380 degrees---do not let it get hotter than 380 degrees! 375 is ideal; keep the thermometer in the pan to continually monitor.<br>2. One to two at a time, gently grab doughnuts and ease them into the hot oil. Allow them to cook 1 minute on each side; they will brown very quickly.<br>3. Remove doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon, allowing all oil to drip off.<br>4. Place doughnut immediately on several layers of paper towels. Count to five, then flip it over onto a clean part of the paper towels. Count to five, then flip it over again; the purpose, obviously, is to drain as much grease as possible before it soaks into the doughnut.<br>5. Repeat with remaining doughnuts and holes. The holes will cook more quickly than the doughnuts; about 30 seconds per side.<br>6. Allow doughnuts to slightly cool.<br><br>To Glaze<br><br>1. Mix all glaze ingredients in a bowl until completely smooth.<br>2. One by one, dip doughnuts into the glaze until halfway submerged. (Note: completely submerge doughnut holes, then remove with slotted spoon.)<br>4. Remove from glaze, then turn right side up on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet (to catch dripping glaze.)<br>5. Serve warm if possible, or room temperature.', 516),
